# Welcome to the Z80 Retro! project repository collection!

The purpose of this organization is to provide an easy way to locate the
repositories of hardware and software projects for the Z80 Retro!

The Z80 Retro! project is presented on the John's Basement channel on YouTube.
A [Z80 Retro!
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3by7evD3F51Cf9QnsAEdgSQ4cz7HQZX5)
contains much detail about all aspects of this project including the circuit
boards, CP/M, the BIOS, and a video display board that uses a popular Video
Display Processor called the TMS9118.

## Pre-Compiled Binaries

There are pre-compiled binaries of the boot ROM flash and SD card image for the
Z80 Retro! in a zip file that is part of [the latest official software release
in github here](https://github.com/Z80-Retro/2063-Z80-cpm/releases/latest).

## PC Boards

The bare PC boards can be ordered directly from manufacturers for under $30 USD
by using the `XXX-gerbers.zip` files that appear in the latest release of the
respective repos.  See the section below named [Hardware Project
Repos](https://github.com/Z80-Retro#hardware-project-repos).  I have been
ordering bare Retro! boards from JLCPCB and get 5 of each (15 total PCBs) for
about $30 USD.  [There is a video on how to order them directly from JLCPCB or
OSHPark here](https://youtu.be/AUg_sbPnzn0).

## Version Tags and the YouTube Video Series

As of 20220304, in order to locate the exact same versions of the source code
as seen in the playlist you can check out (or download) the specific version of
the code using the date-code seen at the start of each video (that look like
this: YYYYMMDD.n)

For each repo in the Z80-Retro github organization, you will find a *git tag*
with the same date-code in it that matches the given videos that are focused on
that repo.  (Click on the tags link in any given repo to see them all.)
